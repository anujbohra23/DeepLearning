## Agents

- **Objective**: To understand the working of agents in the LangChain framework.
- **Description**: Uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to answer user questions.

## API

- **Objective**: To use Ollama for locally downloading models and serving them using FastAPI.
- **Description**: Generates content according to prompts.

## Chatbot

- **Objective**: To build a basic chatbot using Ollama and test its performance in local environments.
- **Description**: A simple implementation of a chatbot to check its working locally.

## Fine-Tuning

- **Objective**: To fine-tune DistilBERT using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning for sentiment analysis.
- **Description**: Fine-tunes DistilBERT and hosts the best model checkpoint on Hugging Face.

## Gemini-Chatbot

- **Objective**: To create a Gemini chatbot using Streamlit.
- **Description**: Builds a Gemini chatbot for conversational purposes.

## NeuralNet

- **Objective**: To understand the architecture and mathematics behind neural networks.
- **Description**: Builds a neural network for the CIFAR Kaggle challenge to classify objects using Transfer Learning with the ResNet50 model. Note that the Kaggle token (`kaggle.json`) is not included in the repository and must be downloaded from Kaggle.
- **Note**: The Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) does not contain the `kaggle.json` file, which needs to be downloaded from Kaggle after creating an API token.

## RAG

- **Objective**: To understand how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works.
- **Description**: Provides insights and implementations to understand RAG.

## Installation

To set up the repository, clone it and install the necessary dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anujbohra23/DeepLearning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
